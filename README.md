For Tree : anytree Lib and from scratch tree for O(n) algortihm

For Graph : networkX Lib and matplotlib for showing the graph

## Max Independent Set for Tree

### Time complexity : O(n*h(n))

Always return correct answer (Always return Max Independent Set)

### Prove : 

**Step 1 : Initialization** The initial set ```unCutNodesSet``` is constructed by adding the root and all descendants. Using ```Root.descendants``` from the ```anytree``` library, this operation takes O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

**Step 2 : Independent Set Iteration** 
- Checking if a node has no children (leaf check) is O(1).
- Appending to ```IndependentSet``` and removing from ```unCutNodesSet``` are both O(1).
- For each non-leaf node, the function calls itself recursively on each child. and we can say if we have k nodes under the selected subtree then complexity should be O(k)
- what does this section do ? it found all of leaf nodes of a subtree then add those to the independent set list then remove all leafs and preant leafs from the tree.

**Step 3 : Main Loop** The main loop iterates as long as unCutNodesSet is not empty. Within each iteration:
- Choosing a node in ```unCutNodesSet```: The line ```next(iter(unCutNodesSet))``` takes O(1) time.
- Calling ```IndependentSetIteration```: The core of the complexity lies in this recursive function.

**Total Complexity :** The while loop calls Independent Set Iteration function O(h(n)) times since Complexity of the Independent Set Iteration function is O(n) then the total complexity should be O(n) + O(n* h(n)) = O(n*h(n))

**Best Case :** Now if we have a full tree it shows the Best case and the complexity should be Î©(n*Log(n)).

**Worst Case :** if we had a line tree then is shows the worst case and the complexity should be O(n^2).

## Optimized Max Independent Set for Tree

### Time complexity : O(n)

### Prove : 

**Step 1 : Tree and Nodes Initialization** 
- Constructing each ```Node``` runs in O(1) wtih attributes like ```data```, ```parent```, ```children```.
- Since constructing the whole tree wtih n ```Nodes``` costs O(n).

**Step 2 : Iteration costs** every steps in while itration costs O(1) and we can say that each iteration costs O(1). 

**Step 2.1 : Constructing Leafs** 
- In the initialization step we add leafs of the tree dynamically each one cost O(1) and for whole tree costs O(n).

**Step 2.2 : Accessing to a Leaf Node** 
- Accessing to a random leaf in a set ```next(iter(tree.leafs))``` Costs O(1)

**Step 2.3 : Adding the Leaf to the Independent Set**
- Appending the leaf to the ```IndependentSet``` list is O(1).

**Step 2.4 : Removing the Leaf**
- Removing the leaf from the ```tree.leafs``` set is O(1) because removing elements from a set is an O(1) operation.

**Step 2.5 : Removing the Parent and Grandparent**
- Removing grandparent children ```leaf.parent.parent.children.remove(leaf.parent)``` costs O(1) because removing elements from a set is an O(1) operation.
- Removing the grandparent ```leaf.parent.parent = None``` costs O(1)
- Removing Parent ```leaf.parent = None``` costs O(1)

**Step 2.6 : Update Leafs set**
- Adding a node to leafs set ```tree.leafs.add(leaf.parent.parent)``` costs O(1)

**Step 3 : Function costs** Each iteration of the while loop costs O(1) since we do this to achive all leafs and then remove the leafs now a graph has n nodes at worst case and we can say that function costs O(n)
 
## Max Independent Set for Graph

### Time complexity : O(V^2+VE)

Sometimes return correct answer (because its greedy algorithm)

### Correct answer :

<img src="/Pictures/3.png"/>

<img src="/Pictures/2.png"/>

<img src="/Pictures/4.png"/>

### Wrong answer :

<img src="/Pictures/5.png"/>

the answer should be : F and E for the A, B, C, E, F, G set and a D node for whole graph then the answer should be : E, F, D but in greedy way we first choose G then can't choose E and F then we just should choose a Node from the complete-4 graph A, B, C, D and the greedy answer being G and A which is incorrect.

## Conclusion :

Greedy algorithm works correct for trees not graphs

Also greedy algorithm for tree has better complexity
