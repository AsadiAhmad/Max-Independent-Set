## Max Independent Set for Tree

### Time complexity : O(n*h(n))

Always return correct answer (Always return Max Independent Set)

### Prove : 

**Step 1 : Initialization** The initial set ```unCutNodesSet``` is constructed by adding the root and all descendants. Using ```Root.descendants``` from the ```anytree``` library, this operation takes O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

**Step 2 : Independent Set Iteration** 
- Checking if a node has no children (leaf check) is O(1).
- Appending to ```IndependentSet``` and removing from ```unCutNodesSet``` are both O(1).
- For each non-leaf node, the function calls itself recursively on each child. and we can say if there is k nodes under this function complexity should be O(k)

**Step 3 : Main Loop** The main loop iterates as long as unCutNodesSet is not empty. Within each iteration:

- Choosing a node in ```unCutNodesSet```: The line ```next(iter(unCutNodesSet))``` takes O(1) time.
- Calling ```IndependentSetIteration```: The core of the complexity lies in this recursive function.

**Total Complexity :** The while loop calls Independent Set Iteration function O(h(n)) times since Complexity of the Independent Set Iteration function is O(n) then the total complexity should be O(n) + O(n*h(n)) = O(n*h(n))

**Best Case :** Now if we have a full tree it shows the Best case and the complexity should be Î©(n*Log(n)).

**Worst Case :** if we had a line tree then is shows the worst case and the complexity should be O(n^2).

## Max Independent Set for Graph

### Time complexity : O(V^2+VE)

Sometimes return correct answer (because its greedy algorithm)

## Conclusion :

Greedy algorithm works correct for trees not graphs

Also greedy algorithm for tree has better complexity
